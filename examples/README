                     The "examples" directory
                     ========================


This directory contains the following five canned scripts to help you
become familiar with this module.  You are urged to execute the scripts as
they are --- without modifying anything in the directory --- in order to
get the results that are shown in the PNG image files.  Here we go:


1)  canned_example1.pl           

          This example illustrates 2D clustering of co-located but
          overloapping clusters with different covariances.

          Unless your run gets trapped in a local maximum, your results
          should look like those shown in the following image files:

             save_example_1_cluster_plot.png          (for hard clustering)

             save_example_1_posterior_prob_plot.png   (for soft clustering)

          If you are using a Linux machine, you can display these image
          files with the 'display' utility.



2)  canned_example2.pl           

          This example illustrates 2D clustering involving non-overlapping
          clusters.

          Unless your run gets trapped in a local maximum, your results
          should look like those shown in the following image files:

             save_example_2_cluster_plot.png          (for hard clustering)

             save_example_2_posterior_prob_plot.png   (for soft clustering)



3)  canned_example3.pl           

          This example illustrates 2D clustering involving overlapping
          clusters whose means are at different locations.

          Unless your run gets trapped in a local maximum, your results
          should look like those shown in the following image files:

             save_example_3_cluster_plot.png          (for hard clustering)

             save_example_3_posterior_prob_plot.png   (for soft clustering)



4)  canned_example4.pl           

          This example illustrates 3D clustering involving non-overlapping
          clusters.

          Unless your run gets trapped in a local maximum, your results
          should look like those shown in the following image files:

             save_example_4_cluster_plot.png          (for hard clustering)

             save_example_4_posterior_prob_plot.png   (for soft clustering)



5)  canned_example5.pl           

          This example illustrates 3D clustering involving overlapping
          clusters.

          Unless your run gets trapped in a local maximum, your results
          should look like those shown in the following image files:

             save_example_5_cluster_plot.png          (for hard clustering)

             save_example_5_posterior_prob_plot.png   (for soft clustering)



========================================================================

Support scripts in the `examples' directory:


1)  For generating the data for experiments with clustering

       data_generator.pl


2)  For cleaning up the `examples' directory

       cleanup_directory.pl
